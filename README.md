This is a web intergrated version of moonlight/Steam remote play built to pass remote connections over the internet to a browser.


This is my first project and mainly serves as a way for me to track my growth in development.


Do not expect this project to be released or maintained.



TO DO:
Remote access (likely simply using RDP, Eventually move to protocals like whats used for steam game streaming)

Web access to host (locally)






Future ideas/wants:
Desktop application

web access to a pool of computers

user accounts linked with game accounts
